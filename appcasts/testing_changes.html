These release notes are for the development builds of iTerm2. If you want something stable, stick with the original iTerm until the first official release of iTerm2.

Alpha 11
Bug fixes! Also brings back i386 and PPC support. Details:

- Restore PPC and i386 support (bug 198).
- In previous alphas, holding down Alt while making a selection would create a rectangular selection. This conflicted with an existing behavior where holding down Alt disables xterm mouse reporting. Now, you must hold down Cmd+Alt to select a rectang.e (bug 124).
- Hopefully fixes a crash with entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
- Improve reliability of opening a tab with the same working dir as the current tab (bug 75).
- Copy now copies tabs properly instead of converting them to spaces (bug 90).
- Prevent multiple bookmarks from having the same shortcut (bug 92).
- When a you use the Finder to launch a script by doing Open With->Iterm and it starts a background process, the background process won't be killed when the script finished (bug 203).
- When a window or tab is closed, send SIGHUP instead of SIGKILL so that login can shut down gracefully (bug 87).
- The refresh rate slider had an insane max. (bug 202).
- Debug logging performance improved.

Alpha 10
The focus of this release is bug fixes. It also features a major performance improvement as well as better internationalization support. This is the first 64-bit release.

- Rewrote drawing code for up to 10x speedup.
- iTerm2 is now a 64-bit binary!
- Improve text rendering by making baselines always line up when mixing fonts and in IME.
- Input method editor improved.
- Bold selections have proper foreground color (bug 106).
- Fix bug where cursor remains I-bar in title (bug 88).
- Resynchornize properly after invalid utf-8 sequence (bug 73).
- Fix bug where opening a tab changes window size.
- Fix race condition when toggling full screen and a draw occurs.
- Fix drawing bugs.
- Fix some minor memory leaks.
- Fix bug where tab bar would not draw correctly after window resize (bug 167).
- Fix bug where one-word commands in a bookmark didn't work (bug 166).

Alpha 9
The main focus of this release is performance, improved internationalization support, and allowing different fonts/sizes in tabs in the same window. Double-width characters are supported as first class citizens now. Rendering performance is greatly improved. Now the details:

Internationalization/Localization
- Make find work correctly for localized unicode search (bug 70).
- Many improvements to the input method editor (bug 105).
- Fix wrapping of double-width characters (bug 71).
- Fix bug with double clicking on words with double-width characters.
- Double-width characters are now always double-width (instead of displaying overlapping characters).
- Only ambiguous characters are affected by the "ambiguous characters are double-width" setting. The preference was renamed so it will be off for everyone by default.

Performance
- Major performance improvements for ASCII text (bug 39).

New Features
- Allow each tab to have a different font, font size, blur, transparency, and anti-alias setting.
- Allow changing of font, blur, antialias, transparency from Edit Session window.

- Make bookmarks window change size correctly (bug 114).
- Fix default escape codes for ctrl
- shift-arrows.
- Fix crash when dragging a tab out of a window.
- Fix bug where key mappings were ignored when focus was in find bar.
- Keep Bookmark and Prefs window in the Spaces screen you're in instead of switching to the app's original screen (bug 147).
- Improve command parsing (bug 121).
- Fix bug where minimize button is disabled when exiting fullscreen mode (bug 86).
- Fix bug where adding a bookmark changes the default bookmark (bug 129).
- Make cmd-number work when focus is in find bar (bug 111).

Miscellaneous
- Improvements to "About iTerm" dialog.
- Remove font size follows window and use transparency menu items.

Alpha 8
Some improvements to the UI for selecting bookmarks. Change to use a new icon! Add global key mappings for cmd-{ and } to switch tabs, ^6 to send ^^, ^- to send ^_. Bugs fixed: cmd-number to switch tabs works again (bug 48). Fix dragging bookmarks (bug 54). Use new xterm keymaps for shift-arrow keys. Correctly display unset shortcuts in bookmarks list (bug 53). Don't close font panel automatically for focus-follows-mouse (bug 51). Fix bug where double clicking on empty line in key mapping crashed. Use bold font for bold text. Improve selection behavior (bug 60). Import "empty" working directory as new "recycle directory" option (bug 65). Make all bold text bright (bug 62). Change default color of bold text to not be red/pink.

Alpha 7
This is a bugfix release. The following bugs are fixed: Cannot backspace in search field in bookmarks drawer (bug 35). Ensure that default bookmark always exists (bug 36). Fixes a crash on termination. Improves appearance of bookmark table views (bug 34). Turn off window resizing by default for new users. Do not lose screen contents on cmd-R (bug 23). Shift-zoom always zooms full screen (bug 24). Fix bug where last character of URL isn't selected on cmd-click (bug 26). Fix problem where specified working directory is ignored with a login shell (bug 44). Fix bug with migrating preferences from iTerm for bookmark commands and close session on end. Fix bug where preferences toolbar button didn't match the displayed view (bug 42).

Alpha 6
This alpha introduces a complete reworking of the Preferences system. Profiles have been removed, as have hierarchical bookmarks. Bookmarks may now be annotated with tags (similar to Gmail labels), and are searchable. To make up for the lack of profiles, it is easy to copy classes of attributes (such as colors) from one bookmark to another. This UI should be considered experimental, and the design will continue to change as feedback is received.

Alpha 5
Bug 2: Redraw problems fixed (one was a race condition, other was a bug with clearing the bottom of the screen). Bug 20: Slowness on idle bug fixed. Bug 19: New selection mechanism: holding down alt selects a rectangular region. Inverted cursor support added. Add support for search-as-you-type for "find". URL detection improved. Support really long scrollback buffers. Remove any vestiges of PPC, 10.4 support. General code cleanup begun. Debug logging added. Fix bug with find losing its spot when scrollback buffer is full. Added some tests.

Alpha 4
Fix jump-to-scroll to stay at the scroll position. Fixed bug 13: cannot select one character.
Apply patch from iTerm1 bug 2905335: adds an option to disable smart placement and saves window positions in prefs.
Migrate old preferences, fixing bug 5. Also remove some extraneous build files from svn.
Fix bug where display is corrupted when reizing with font size follows window turned on (bug 3).


Alpha 3
Fixed some warnings in PTYTask. Moved assertion in linebuffer per bug 9.
Fix a bug in the psmtabbar where they mutate an array while enumerating it. Also fix a race condition that caused Major fail! crashes or dereferencing free memory in PTYTask by properly locking the list of tasks and tolerating closed fd rather than hoping usleep prevents the race (hint: it doesn't)


Alpha 2
Added link to homepage.
Fixed some bugs with find. Changed credits. Updated Sparkle for the new site.
Rewrote find for better performance. Unicode not working so great now, though.


Alpha 1
Find feature moved into a toolbar
Slowness on resize fixed.
Find performance increased (but searching is temporarily not conforming with unicode best practices for non-ascii text)
Capslock doesn't break command-number ot change tabs
