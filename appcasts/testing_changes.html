These release notes are for the development builds of iTerm2. If you want something stable, stick with the original iTerm until the first official release of iTerm2.

Alpha 5
Bug 2: Redraw problems fixed (one was a race condition, other was a bug with clearing the bottom of the screen). Bug 20: Slowness on idle bug fixed. Bug 19: New selection mechanism: holding down alt selects a rectangular region. Inverted cursor support added. Add support for search-as-you-type for "find". URL detection improved. Support really long scrollback buffers. Remove any vestiges of PPC, 10.4 support. General code cleanup begun. Debug logging added. Fix bug with find losing its spot when scrollback buffer is full. Added some tests.

Alpha 4
Fix jump-to-scroll to stay at the scroll position. Fixed bug 13: cannot select one character.
Apply patch from iTerm1 bug 2905335: adds an option to disable smart placement and saves window positions in prefs.
Migrate old preferences, fixing bug 5. Also remove some extraneous build files from svn.
Fix bug where display is corrupted when reizing with font size follows window turned on (bug 3).


Alpha 3
Fixed some warnings in PTYTask. Moved assertion in linebuffer per bug 9.
Fix a bug in the psmtabbar where they mutate an array while enumerating it. Also fix a race condition that caused Major fail! crashes or dereferencing free memory in PTYTask by properly locking the list of tasks and tolerating closed fd rather than hoping usleep prevents the race (hint: it doesn't)


Alpha 2
Added link to homepage.
Fixed some bugs with find. Changed credits. Updated Sparkle for the new site.
Rewrote find for better performance. Unicode not working so great now, though.


Alpha 1
Find feature moved into a toolbar
Slowness on resize fixed.
Find performance increased (but searching is temporarily not conforming with unicode best practices for non-ascii text)
Capslock doesn't break command-number ot change tabs
