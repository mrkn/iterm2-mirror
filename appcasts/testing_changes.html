These release notes are for the development builds of iTerm2. If you want something stable, stick with the original iTerm until the first official release of iTerm2.

Alpha 13
This release includes the much-requested Visor-like hotkey feature plus an innovative new Autocomplete feature. There are plenty of bug fixes, too.

Enhancements
- Autocomplete: Do you find yourself using the mouse to copy and paste text all the time? No longer must you reach for the rodent! Just type the start of a word that has appeared in the current session (or appears anywhere in text that you've copy-pasted) and hit cmd-;. iTerm2 shows the words you might be looking for, and magically puts the best one at the top of the list!
- Hotkey: You can register a "hotkey" that brings iTerm2 to the foreground when you're in another application.
- Adds a preference to disable changing tab title appearance to indicate activity.

Bug Fixes
- Paste history window opens in the same Space as your window (268).
- Control-Q fixed (273).
- Cmd-+ with max-size window caused brokenness.
- Various memory leaks fixed.
- Improved behavior of paste history window.
- Fix Control-/, Control-?, Control-shift-Y (285).
- Fix LANG and LC_* vars (290, 281).
- Fix Copy From in edit session dialog (272).
- Select and escape URLs properly (291).
- Display font names properly in Asian locales (264).


Alpha 12
Featurepalooza! And bug fixes, too.

New features:
- Instant Replay: This feature makes iTerm2 behave like TiVo. You can press cmd-opt-b to step back in time and cmd-opt-f to step forward in time. If something is erased from the screen, it's no longer lost forever. This feature can be turned off in Preferences as it does take a bit of extra memory and has a small performance impact (less than 1%).
- Paste History: When you copy or paste text in iTerm2, it is now saved in the paste history. You can pop up a window at the cursor with cmd-shift-h which shows the last 20 strings in the clipboard. The list is searchable Quicksilver-style.
- Mouseless Selection: Do you often copy-paste text within the same window? Now you can do it without using the mouse. Open the findbar with cmd-f and search for the text you wish to copy. When part of the text is matched, use the tab key to expand the selection to the right by a full word and shift-tab to expand it left to the previous word boundary. It's automatically copied to the clipboard, or you can use opt-Enter to paste the selection immediately.

Enhancements:
- Findbar appearance improved.
- Add undo/redo to edit menu.
- Add zoom shortcut for cmd-opt-=.
- Read larger chunks from the network for better performance.
- Idle CPU usage reduced.
- Refresh rate adjustment removed, dynamic refresh rate added.
- Input Method Editor wraps at end of line, scrolls window if necessary.
- IPV6 support for Bonjour.

Bug fixes:
- Memory usage growth when Bonjour enabled (hopefully, 43).
- Toggling Bonjour takes effect immediately (89)
- Make resize look better (98)
- Restore colors on exit of Vim (99)
- Make bookmark window resize properly (114)
- Select name field when copying/creating/editing bookmark (127, 128, 181)

Alpha 11
Bug fixes! Also brings back i386 and PPC support. Details:

- Restore PPC and i386 support (bug 198).
- In previous alphas, holding down Alt while making a selection would create a rectangular selection. This conflicted with an existing behavior where holding down Alt disables xterm mouse reporting. Now, you must hold down Cmd+Alt to select a rectang.e (bug 124).

- Improve reliability of opening a tab with the same working dir as the current tab (bug 75).
- Copy now copies tabs properly instead of converting them to spaces (bug 90).
- Prevent multiple bookmarks from having the same shortcut (bug 92).
- When a you use the Finder to launch a script by doing Open With->Iterm and it starts a background process, the background process won't be killed when the script finished (bug 203).
- When a window or tab is closed, send SIGHUP instead of SIGKILL so that login can shut down gracefully (bug 87).
- The refresh rate slider had an insane max. (bug 202).
- Debug logging performance improved.

Alpha 10
The focus of this release is bug fixes. It also features a major performance improvement as well as better internationalization support. This is the first 64-bit release.

- Fix bug where tab bar would not draw correctly after window resize (bug 167).
- Fix bug where one-word commands in a bookmark didn't work (bug 166).

Alpha 9
The main focus of this release is performance, improved internationalization support, and allowing different fonts/sizes in tabs in the same window. Double-width characters are supported as first class citizens now. Rendering performance is greatly improved. Now the details:

Internationalization/Localization

- Fix bug with double clicking on words with double-width characters.
- Double-width characters are now always double-width (instead of displaying overlapping characters).
- Only ambiguous characters are affected by the "ambiguous characters are double-width" setting. The preference was renamed so it will be off for everyone by default.

Performance
- Major performance improvements for ASCII text (bug 39).

New Features
- Allow each tab to have a different font, font size, blur, transparency, and anti-alias setting.
- Allow changing of font, blur, antialias, transparency from Edit Session window.

Alpha 8
Some improvements to the UI for selecting bookmarks. Change to use a new icon! Add global key mappings for cmd-{ and } to switch tabs, ^6 to send ^^, ^- to send ^_. Bugs fixed: cmd-number to switch tabs works again (bug 48). Fix dragging bookmarks (bug 54). Use new xterm keymaps for shift-arrow keys. Correctly display unset shortcuts in bookmarks list (bug 53). Don't close font panel automatically for focus-follows-mouse (bug 51). Fix bug where double clicking on empty line in key mapping crashed. Use bold font for bold text. Improve selection behavior (bug 60). Import "empty" working directory as new "recycle directory" option (bug 65). Make all bold text bright (bug 62). Change default color of bold text to not be red/pink.

Alpha 7
This is a bugfix release. The following bugs are fixed: Cannot backspace in search field in bookmarks drawer (bug 35). Ensure that default bookmark always exists (bug 36). Fixes a crash on termination. Improves appearance of bookmark table views (bug 34). Turn off window resizing by default for new users. Do not lose screen contents on cmd-R (bug 23). Shift-zoom always zooms full screen (bug 24). Fix bug where last character of URL isn't selected on cmd-click (bug 26). Fix problem where specified working directory is ignored with a login shell (bug 44). Fix bug with migrating preferences from iTerm for bookmark commands and close session on end. Fix bug where preferences toolbar button didn't match the displayed view (bug 42).

Alpha 6
This alpha introduces a complete reworking of the Preferences system. Profiles have been removed, as have hierarchical bookmarks. Bookmarks may now be annotated with tags (similar to Gmail labels), and are searchable. To make up for the lack of profiles, it is easy to copy classes of attributes (such as colors) from one bookmark to another. This UI should be considered experimental, and the design will continue to change as feedback is received.

Alpha 5
Bug 2: Redraw problems fixed (one was a race condition, other was a bug with clearing the bottom of the screen). Bug 20: Slowness on idle bug fixed. Bug 19: New selection mechanism: holding down alt selects a rectangular region. Inverted cursor support added. Add support for search-as-you-type for "find". URL detection improved. Support really long scrollback buffers. Remove any vestiges of PPC, 10.4 support. General code cleanup begun. Debug logging added. Fix bug with find losing its spot when scrollback buffer is full. Added some tests.

Alpha 4
Fix jump-to-scroll to stay at the scroll position. Fixed bug 13: cannot select one character.
Apply patch from iTerm1 bug 2905335: adds an option to disable smart placement and saves window positions in prefs.
Migrate old preferences, fixing bug 5. Also remove some extraneous build files from svn.
Fix bug where display is corrupted when reizing with font size follows window turned on (bug 3).


Alpha 3
Fixed some warnings in PTYTask. Moved assertion in linebuffer per bug 9.
Fix a bug in the psmtabbar where they mutate an array while enumerating it. Also fix a race condition that caused Major fail! crashes or dereferencing free memory in PTYTask by properly locking the list of tasks and tolerating closed fd rather than hoping usleep prevents the race (hint: it doesn't)


Alpha 2
Added link to homepage.
Fixed some bugs with find. Changed credits. Updated Sparkle for the new site.
Rewrote find for better performance. Unicode not working so great now, though.


Alpha 1
Find feature moved into a toolbar
Slowness on resize fixed.
Find performance increased (but searching is temporarily not conforming with unicode best practices for non-ascii text)
Capslock doesn't break command-number ot change tabs
